## Overview
In this project we have created a CLI based video game to guess a word using Node.JS. We are using the NPM package "random-word" to randomly guess a word and NPM package
"inquirer" for user input. The input validation will make sure the user inputs only a-z. Everytime an user guess the correct letter, it will prompt in green "CORRECT !!!" and for an incorrect guess, it will prompt in red "INCORRECT !!! Number of Guesses Remaining: xx". The user can guess up to 15 times and every time he/she guesses a wrong letter, the counter will be reduced by 1. Once the use enters all the correct letters to construct the word or runs out of guesses, they game will be over and it will guess the next word and restart the game. Users can exit it the game at any time by pressing <CTRL> + C.

Here are few more relavant screen shots for this game:-
